# 🚀 Welcome to SimplestLearn Wiki!

Welcome to your journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**!

This wiki is designed to teach you the fundamentals of AI/ML in the **simplest, most intuitive way possible**. No complex math. No boring jargon. Just clear explanations and real-world examples.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

Our curriculum is organized into foundational lessons that build on each other:

### **Lesson 1: Introduction to AI/ML/DL** 🤖
Learn what AI really is and how it's organized into different "dolls" - from Artificial Intelligence down to Deep Learning. Perfect for understanding the big picture!

### **Lesson 2: The Three Flavors of Machine Learning** 🍦
Discover the three main types of machine learning: Supervised Learning (learning with answers), Unsupervised Learning (finding patterns), and Reinforcement Learning (learning by doing).

### **Lesson 3: Classification vs Regression** 🎯
Dive deep into Supervised Learning and learn about the two main problems ML solves: sorting things into categories (classification) or predicting numbers (regression).

### **Lesson 4: Getting Your Data Ready** 🍳
Learn the most important step in any AI project: preparing your data! We'll cover how to turn words into numbers (encoding) and handle real-world problems like missing data.

### **Lesson 5: Your First AI Model** 🌳
Time to code! We'll use the powerful `scikit-learn` library to build our first real machine learning model, a Decision Tree, in just a few lines of Python.

### **Lesson 6: Under the Hood** 🛠️
For the truly curious, we'll pull back the curtain and build a learning Decision Tree algorithm from scratch to see how the magic really works.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with **Lesson 1** to understand the fundamentals, then progress through the lessons in order. Each one builds on the previous, taking you from a beginner to a true AI builder!
